# Spotify Clone

A simple music player web application that allows you to play and pause a song using a play/pause button. The player also features an audio range slider for potential future functionalities and some basic control icons.

## Project Overview

This project is a basic implementation of a music player with HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. It includes:
- An image cover for the song
- Basic song metadata (title and artist)
- Audio controls for playback
- A play/pause button that toggles the audio state

## Features

- **Play/Pause Functionality**: Toggle between playing and pausing the song using the play/pause button.
- **Audio Control**: Use an audio slider (range input) to potentially control audio playback (not yet functional in this implementation).
- **Control Icons**: Basic icons for shuffle, previous, play/pause, next, and repeat functionalities (functionality for these icons not implemented).

## Installation

1. **Clone the Repository**

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/hricha11/spotify-clone.git
